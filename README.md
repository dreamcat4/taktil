Typewig
==========================

Typewig is a lightweight framework and integrated build tool designed to simplify the process of developing Bitwig controller scripts. The framework is designed around the idea of building reusable, shareable components and provides a simple, but powerful, view abstraction that makes contextually mapping hardware controls to different components a breeze.

The integrated build tool leverages the powers of TypeScript and Rollup.js to enable ES2015+ language features in Bitwig's ES3 world (no messy build configurations necessary). Whether you want to go all in with TypeScript (recommended) or stick with plain old pure (but modern) JavaScript, Typewig has got you covered.
