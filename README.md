Taktil
==========================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/taktiljs/taktil.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/taktiljs/taktil) [![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/taktil.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/taktil)

Taktil is a lightweight control surface scripting framework for Bitwig Studio that encourages rapid development and community code reuse. At its core, it is designed around the idea of building reusable, extendable components and provides a simple but powerful view abstraction that makes contextually mapping hardware controls to different components a breeze.

Taktil's integrated build tool leverages the powers of TypeScript and Webpack to enable ES2015+ language features in Bitwig's ES5 world (no messy build configurations necessary). Whether you want to go all in with TypeScript (recommended) or stick with plain old pure (but modern) JavaScript, Taktil has got you covered.

> **Warning!** While fully usable, Taktil is still pre-1.0 and has no backwards compatibility guarantees until the 1.0 release occurs!
